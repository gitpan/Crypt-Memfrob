NAME
    Crypt::Memfrob - memfrob implementation in pure Perl

SYNOPSIS
      use Crypt::Memfrob 'memfrob';
      my $frobed = memfrob($str);

DESCRIPTION
    This package provides one function 'memfrob.' This is equivalent to the
    memfrob function included in glibc. With this library, you can generate
    glibc-compatible frobnicated (encrypted) strings, and defrobnicate
    glibc-generated strings, in Perl.

FUNCTIONS
    memfrob
        This function frobnicates given string and returns the result.

FROBNICATION
    This library is based on GNU libc 2.2.4. From memfrob(3):

       The memfrob() function encrypts the first n bytes of the
       memory areas by exclusive-ORing each character with the
       number 42.  The effect can be reversed by using memfrob()
       on the encrypted memory area.

       Note that this function is not a proper encryption routine
       as the XOR constant is fixed, and is only suitable for
       hiding strings.

SEE ALSO
    memfrob(3).
